	abstract = {The problem of estimating and predicting position and orientation (pose) of a camera is approached by fusing measurements from inertial sensors (accelerometers and rate gyroscopes) and vision. The sensor fusion approach described in this contribution is based on non-linear filtering of these complementary sensors. This way, accurate and robust pose estimates are available for the primary purpose of augmented reality applications, but with the secondary effect of reducing computation time and improving the performance in vision processing. A real-time implementation of a multi-rate extended Kalman filter is described, using a dynamic model with 22 states, where 12.5 Hz correspondences from vision and 100 Hz inertial measurements are processed. An example where an industrial robot is used to move the sensor unit is presented. The advantage with this configuration is that it provides ground truth for the pose, allowing for objective performance evaluation. The results show that we obtain an absolute accuracy of 2 cm in position and 1° in orientation.},

	abstract = {Texturing is indispensable for the realistic rendering since it adds surface details that are usually too complex to be modeled directly. Conventional {2D} texture mapping remains the most usual approach to texturing, in particular for real-time applications. However, there are some major drawbacks inherent to this approach: the distortion and the discontinuity of textures as well as the lack of the “third” dimension information (geometric effects like roughcast cannot be rendered). {3D} texturing has been introduced to computer graphics to resolve these problems. There are two types of {3D} texturing: solid texturing that consists of defining color variations through the entire {3D} space instead of the {2D} one and geometric texturing that consists of adding a “real” third dimension information to surfaces in the form of “real” apparent geometry. This paper presents a detailed survey of {3D} texturing. Main principles, advantages, drawbacks and applications are presented. The crucial problem of {3D} textures synthesis is studied with a particular attention to analytical methods as well as physical-based models that can provide interesting solutions to this problem.},
